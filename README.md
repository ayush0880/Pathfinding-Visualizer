# Pathfinding-Visualizer
**Pathfinding Visualizer** is an interactive tool that demonstrates algorithms like A*, Dijkstra's, BFS, and DFS finding the shortest path on a grid. Users can place start/end nodes, add obstacles, and create mazes to see step-by-step explorations. Perfect for learning, it compares algorithm efficiency and highlights decision-making.
